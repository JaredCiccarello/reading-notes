My Name's Jared and I think JavaScript is OuttaSight!

**What growth mindset means to me**
What I am today does not define where I am going. Until then, the possibility are endless, my only true obstacle is my willingness to sacrifice my time in order to change or stay stagnant.

1. Reminder 1 Remembering to breath when things are hard or complicatd. Learning is like flexing a muscle, it does not work if you suffocate it.
2. Reminder 2 When you're lost, simply start with what needs to get done, focus on a goal. Then find a place where you are confused and simply work from there.
3. Reminder 3 Don't beat yourself up if you're not where you thought you should be. Steps might be harder for you because you never learned to build from here. It's like being in the matrix and realizing that you've never really used your legs before. Thank you morpheus.
4. ~~Reminder 6 I like to dance in a circle reciting taylor swift songs~~

What are four important features to look for in a text editor? 
1.) code completion; 
2.) syntax
highlighting; 
3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue); 
4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them.

What do the following commands do?
* pwd short for Print Working Directory is plain listing of our current location
* ls, short for list, Lists the contents of a directory.
* cd short for change directories, moves to another directory
* mkdir created one or more directories specified by the Directory parameter
* touch modify a timestamp the utility is used for file creation, although this is not its primary function.

cd projects
mkdir new-project
touch new-project/newfile.md
cd ..
ls projects/new-project

When these commands are strung together we are creating a new project file. First we have cd that moves directories into our projects folder. Next mkdir cmd creates a directory, where we name our new file new-project. Next the touch cmd updates the access and modification times of each file specified, in this case it would be "new-project/newfile.md". Next using cmd cd .. we go back a step into projects/new-project. Last we use the ls cmd to list all of the files located inside of this specified folder.
