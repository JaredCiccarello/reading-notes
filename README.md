My Name's Jared and I think JavaScript is OuttaSight!

**What growth mindset means to me**
What I am today does not define where I am going. Until then, the possibility are endless, my only true obstacle is my willingness to sacrifice my time in order to change or stay stagnant.

1. Reminder 1 Remembering to breath when things are hard or complicatd. Learning is like flexing a muscle, it does not work if you suffocate it.
2. Reminder 2 When you're lost, simply start with what needs to get done, focus on a goal. Then find a place where you are confused and simply work from there.
3. Reminder 3 Don't beat yourself up if you're not where you thought you should be. Steps might be harder for you because you never learned to build from here. It's like being in the matrix and realizing that you've never really used your legs before. Thank you morpheus.
4. ~~Reminder 6 I like to dance in a circle reciting taylor swift songs~~
