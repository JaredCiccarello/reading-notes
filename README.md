My Name's Jared and I think JavaScript is MAGICAL!

**What growth mindset means to me**

1. Reminder 1 Through struggle, I find peace in the knowledge that I have earned the right to be where I am today
2. Reminder 2 We are simply a byproduct of the work that we put into our own lives. Life was never going to be easy but, through struggle we find that we become stronger despite it.
3. Reminder 3 When I overcome struggle, I realize my true potential, giving myself a way forward by becoming who I was always meant to be. Great.
4. ~~Reminder 6 I am able to be a failure on my own terms~~
