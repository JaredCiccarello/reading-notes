1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
    The relationship between REST (Representationaly State Transfer) and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) is that REST applications are built around resources, which involve CRUD-like functions. Both of these are nearly the same but, the differences are varied.

    With CRUD we use:    With Rest (HTTP) we use:
    Create                   POST/PUT
    Read                     GET
    Update                   PUT/POST/PATCH
    Delete                   DELETE



2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

    This was taken from (Nordicapis) website
    1. Client-Server: The client and server act independently.
    2. Stateless: The server does not record the state of the client.
    3. Cacheable: The server marks whether data is cacheable.
    4. Uniform Interface: The client and server interact in a uniform and predictable way. An important aspect of this is that the server exposes resources.
    5. Layered System: The application behaves the same regardless of any intermediaries between the client and server.
