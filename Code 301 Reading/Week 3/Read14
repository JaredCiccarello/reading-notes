Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
    In 1970 toys were being advertised to boys. 

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
    The first computers were toys that were marketed strictly to boys only, leading to a sharp decline in women wanting to learn to code.

Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?
    When company leaders make a commitment to drive change.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?
    Diverse groups of people see problems from different points of view, which leads to faster problem solving.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
    Diversity allows for users to engage a larger audience, instead of just through the lens of our own understanding. For instance, right hand users will never know what it's like to be left handed. Same way with able bodied users, not understanding the struggles of a disability. Even users with a stygma come to mind when allowing for people to create new features to better help those smaller audiences.
