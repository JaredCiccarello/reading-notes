Micha Goebig-10x your confidence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LONfwt-aZ3U

Confidence is not something that you have the time to simply grow. Looking at myself right now, I'm not confident I can really make it anywhere. I feel continuously demoralized at my own abilities. I feel like I should be better at networking, job searching, researching, organization, attention to detail, consistent work ethic. However I find, that while I'm great at all these things, I'm severly lacking in my standard of where I feel I should be at.
I love this topic because it helps me see that not everyone is confident, nor are they all simply experts. Each one of us is growing to shape ourselves into something truly spectacular.

A key take away is that anyone can lead themselves into a better role by leaning into new things. You are only limited by whether or not you know what you need to work on. It's not fear that should drive us, it's working towards something that we weren't sure we could do before. Taking yourself outside of your comfort zone will be hard to get used to but, we can move forward.
