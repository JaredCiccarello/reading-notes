You have learned more in 3 weeks than you realize.

Don't worry about not knowing small pieces, keep working on figuring that out with your team.

Soft skills are necessary. Even if you aren't a great coder, you can still get chosen for a great personality or good communication.




    Project planning
Agile V Waterfall

    Waterfall
    - Find client/client finds us
    -Agreement to build something
    -Workflow: Work til deadline

    Ideal scenario: Present client with finished project on time
    Reality: Can't make deadline, ends up costing more money, 
    
    Don't have something we can sell. Reasons:
     - We thought the market wanted this. Does not.
     - It's not what client wanted
    Result: Lost money/time on project

ADOBE: Bad company?
Very few of their products were built from the ground up.

Illustrator - start to finish
acrobat - start to finish

They would find small companies that had burned out, then buy them to reuse them.

Photoshop bought from "Knolls Bros"
InDesign - Aldus
After Effects - CoSa
Dreamweaver - Macromedia
Pagemaker - Aldus
Flash - Macromedia

    Agile

    - Find client/Client finds us
    - Agreement to build something
    - Workflow: Build in iterative workflows (Different from waterfall)
        - Create goals to reach at each iterative step. Make the goals self contained. 
        - Test product and consulting with client at each iterative step. This means that we discuss with the client if they like it, then check with the market, then build something. Rinse and repeat.

Minimal viable product (MVP): What is the smallest version of your product that will work? 

First ipod: Oct. 2001



Project
Decide on your MVP
 - What is essential for your project to work?
 - Smaller MVP is best

Make a UML - Flowchart of logic required to build your project
Make wireframes
Divide up taks into small tasks. You will use a project task manager.

Project prep:
Prep 1: Group working agreement
Prep 2: Pitch ideas (need 2)
Prep 3: Create assets - github repos (github organization), planning board
Prep 4: Make the plan - How are you going to build this thing?

We need it to be so detailed that someone else can come and build it from scratch if necessary.

Absolutely okay if you don't start coding until Tuesday.

Prep 3
How do we get around some of these issues?

Git comes with main branch
create second branch AKA div branch

Main branch is (Customer facing)

~10:42~
Commit before you pull
pull before you push

Create new branches for each individual task

Create an organization in GitHub
Branches > Protection rule > two approvals 
Make this for main and div branches
