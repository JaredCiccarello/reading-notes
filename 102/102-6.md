Javascript is a compiled programming language.

Non-browser environments also use this language like Node.js, apache, couchdb and even adobe.

To be clear, javascript is NOT java programming. 

Most things are objects in javascript.

Javascript is an essential part to front-end development.

There are 3 major parts of Javascript
1. Language itself
2. Dom API - This shows how the language can interact with the various parts of a web page while in the browser.
Server API - This is provided by Node.js or one of the other server-side systems.

You can embed Javascript into an HTML file or put a line in the HTML file that inclues the external Javascript file.
In order to do this we use <script> tags

Input/Output: Javascript can display text for the user (output). The simplest method is by using an alert function.
