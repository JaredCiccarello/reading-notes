To know which one is truly superior, for your tastes, you'll need to take notice of 4 key features.
1. Code completion
2. Syntax
3. Variety of themes
4. Ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

There's a shorthand language called "Emmet" that will speed up your code writing faster.

Syntax highlighting makes all of your code color coded, making it easier to find errors and read your overall code.
