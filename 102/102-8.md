# Class 8 || Loops & Logic

Question 2: What's the advantage of using functions?
Well named function
Functions help us avoid repeated code.
Functions let us define the code
Functions make code reusable

Question 4
declaring a function
the code executed at the time the function
function are invoked by using parenthesis

FOCUS ONLY ON WHILE AND FOR STATEMENTS

        Declarations
    JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.

    var
    Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

    let
    Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

    const
    Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.

* had precendence over +
You can overrride this by using () creating a grouped expression

JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator

A unary operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator:
operator operand
operand operator

This shows the example of a block statement
var x = 5;
let y = 1;

if (true) {
  var x = 3;
  let y = 2;
}

console.log(x);
// Expected output: 2

console.log(y);
// Expected output: 1


When a for loop executes, the following occurs:

The initializing expression initialization, if any, is executed. This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity. This expression can also declare variables.
The condition expression is evaluated. If the value of condition is true, the loop statements execute. Otherwise, the for loop terminates. (If the condition expression is omitted entirely, the condition is assumed to be true.)
The statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ }) to group those statements.
If present, the update expression afterthought is executed.
Control returns to Step 2.


Console will read each line and follow the logic down the list. 
let x = 10
console.log(x)
x-=10;
console.log("second", x);
x++; (two plus signs equal 1)
console.log("third", x);
x--; (two plus signs equal -1)
console.log("fourth", x);

These are all the same
x += 1
x = 1
x++

This is an example of a WHILE loop
let userGuess = prompt('Pick a number between 1&3")
while (userGuess !==2){
    let userGuess = prompt("Pick a number between 1&3")
}

        let myPassword = 'password'
        let userAnswer = prompt("what is the password?")

        while 
        (userAnswwer = prompt ("What is the password?"))

!== this statement means NOT strictly equal

parseInt command turns a string into a number.



Anytime a LOOP runs it is considered an ITERATION

The difference between a FOR loop and a WHILE loop? 


        let students = 9

        for (let i = 1; i <= students; i++){
            console.log("Hello student #" + i);
        }

Break Statement
Using a break statement terminates a loop, switch, or in conjunction with a labeled statement.


What is an expression in JavaScript? an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

Why would we use a loop in our code? The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.

When does a for loop stop executing? A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false

How many times will a while loop execute? Infinity and Beyond!

function sayHello() {
  console.log('Hello!');
}
