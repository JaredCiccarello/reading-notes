301 Orientation!

frosted poptarts or organic poptarts
iphone or android

How do we mitigate biases?

    301 different from 201

Materials really build off of each other
V important that each lab be submitted

201 labs account 35% of grade
301 labs account 15% of grade

This is because there are code challenges.

Time box the code challenge. Labs are more important.

Reminder, readings are ONLY for familiarity NOT memorization or understanding. Do the readings!

Reflections (Learning journal) are being called RETRO's. This is a reflection on what you're learning.

Career stuff will be used in 401. Save any responses on the assignments.

Start building connections NOW! 

Who is the 401 python instructor?






    ARROW FUNCTIONS
~ 10:10 ~

let arrowAdd = a => a + 6;
let arrowAdd2 = (a, b) => a + b

let arrowAddCurly = (a,b) => {
    let sum = a + b;
    return sum;

use or
use return a + b;
}

Easy thing to forget! "return" is typically always used in a code block

"this" has different powers and it's fine to avoid this for now.

    CLASSES

// 201 constructor
function Musician(artist, style) {
    this.artist = artist;
    this.style = style;
    this.isAmazing = true'
}

let beyonce = new Musician('Beyonce', 'R&B and Soul');
console.log(beyonce);


// Class
class MusicianClass {
    constructor(artist, style) {
        this.artist = artist;
        this.style = style;
    }
}

let beyonceClassInstance = new MusicianClass('Beyonce', 'R&B and Soul');
console.log(beyonceClassInstance)

The class should look similar with the exception of this.isAmazing = true

The big difference between classes and constructors is that we can extend them.



class MusicGroup extends MusicianClass {
    constructor(artist, style, members) {
        // this is a method that feeds things up to the class
        super (artist, style);
        this.members = members
    }
}


~ 10:33 ~
Adding methods


~10:44~
    Code Challenge

Code setup

npm install code 301 setup

node modules folder that acts as your engine

Each day you will be bringing a code challenge into each file for that day

Scrolling up will show you what is passing and failing

6 questions that you'll need to do.
Timebox this to ONE HOUR.

ModZilla for Array.prototype.forEach() has better documentation. Go through the full page, it will be very informative.

???? is different than the i++

~11:10~
// This is called a callback function
arr.forEach(add6) => (
    let sum = a + 6;
    newerArr.push(sum);
)


    TODAY'S LAB

What is react? JavaScript library used to build user interfaces.
This is similiar to chart.js

UI: Button that user clicks on, stuff that gets generated.

~11:31~
Repeating code:
D on't
R epeat
Y ourself

Writing code that isn't easy to maintain is hard to change.

How do we avoid this? Create a component.

Instead of hard coding every single time, you create a component that follows the same logic.
    THIS IS THE REAL POWER OF REACT


    Instance of React

// To create a New Instance of react
NPX createReact.App

Lab: gallery-of-horns
    (NPM WARN deprecate version of TAR no longer supported)

You can use HTML inside of our JS in order to help our brains understand what we are doing instead of using "append" "clickevent"

We can't just go live from here.

We need to run a code: npm start


Functional components and Class components.

Functional components are newer.

301 we will learn class components.

// 3 things you'll need for EVERY class component
1. Import React from 'react
2. Declare the class: Class App extends React.Component {}
3. export the class
export default App:

~11:55~
    render(){
        return <h1>Welcome to 301</h1>;
        )
    }

return can only return one thing wrapped around it.

~12:00 - 12:07~
Now I want to create a website that will return an article for everyone in the 301 class.

~12:13~ Props 
This help create multiple instances of a component.

Prop is an object. 

<Person name='individual'>

~12:18~ Just get the "name" from prop
.name drills down to find only the name

ctrl c in terminal to get out of library


~12:24~  Create github repo
DO NOT touch anything else after repository name
