Recruiter employment
Is this a reputable company?
Be sure to vet people.
Jobs not doing technical interviews? Usually multi step

After bootcamp keep working on individual projects


10 minute talk about lab


~9:16~ Code Challenge 5

We need REDUCE to take objects from our array and put them into a new function

Question 5
// Very first parameter it takes CALLBACK => {}
// Callback function takes in arguments
// return arr.reduce({nameArr, currentChar) => {
  // nameArr.push();
  // return.nameArr;
// }

REPLIT
let arr = [2,6,3,,9,5];

let newArr = arr.reduce((prev, curr) => {
    console.log(prev,curr);
    prev.push(curr);
    return prev;
}, []);

Because prev is an array, now we can do .push
If you made the empty array 0 instead the final value would stay 0. If it is kept as an array, the final value will be an empty array.

~???~ Question 5 SOLVED


Question 6

const reversedString = (str) => {

};

let str = 'this is a string'

let arrFromStr = str.split('');
console.log(arrFromStr);

console will be 'this is a string'

adding .split will split each letter from the word into indvidual strings 't' 'h' 'i' 's'

We can't do reduce on an array
We need to turn string into array
We will need to use str.split

let arr = str.split('');

~9:54~ Question 6 SOLVED

~9:53~ PRACTICE THIS ON REPLIT



~10:05~ Code Challenge 6 REVIEW

let pets =['fido', 'Spot', 'Sparky'];
let copiedPets = pets
console.log('pets: ', pets);
console.log('copiedPets: ', pets);

copiedPets.push('Buddy');
console.log('pets: ', pets);
console.log('copiedPets: ', pets);

// Arrays and Object don't work the same way

How do we get around the buddy from being on the pets array and stay only on the pets array? A deep copy.

[...pets] this creates a mini for loop
this spits out all the values of pets outside of an array



~10:24~ TERNARIES

basic format of a ternary


What ? true : false
storeIsOpen ? console.log('open') : console.log('closed');

storeIsOpen
    ? console.log('open')
    : console.log('closed');

These do the same thing.


~10:30~ Lab 6 REVIEW

How are we getting information?

WRRC: Web Request Response Cycle

How do we define the diffrence between the front end and the back end? 
Front-end: What user see's
Back-end: What happens on someone else's computer


FOR LAB 6 we will make a request to 

REST: Representational State Transfer
Get
Post
Delete
Put

Think of it like this: 
    If I have a gift and I want to give it to you.
    There are a number of ways I could do this.
    Drive it.
    Deliver it.
    Meet at a place.
    If I deliver it there are a multitude of steps that I need 


??????????????????????




Dealing with AXIOS? Do these 3 things.
1. async
2. await
3. data

Personal Note: Console.log will help you identify what each element renders.


~11:38~ char.name STRONG POINT OF CONFUSION
Naming variables needs to be clear so that we can understand what data we need to call to dig down into specific data that we would like to express.

If you find data from an API make sure it's stable


~11:40~ Lab for today

You'll need axios
get a location key

Running an API costs money
    - web hosting
    - Traffic


    HIDING CRITICAL DATA
When we have critical information that we don't want others to have, we should create: .env file

what does .gitignore do? Allows you to hide certain files
got into gitignore and add .env
.env does not get pushed up to github

All .env files need REACT_APP_

LOCATIONIO_API_KEY=

If I want someone to read my files
.env.sample
REACT_APP_LOCATIONIO_API_KEY=<your-api-key>

Search/Forward Geocoding on locationIQ

Abstract use a template literal `1`

~12:13~ This will search for whatever city I pass in

~12:15~ process.env


~12:20~ FINALLY reviewing the lab



~12:27~ Add in some error handling

Netlify will not have access to API key


~12:34~ Try catch


try {

} catch (error) {

}

Try is kind of like your if

put this inside your swCode

Should have drawings of 5 different WRRC
