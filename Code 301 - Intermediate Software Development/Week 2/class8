~9:07~ Code Challenge 7

Question 6

We need to drill down and only do the ingredients list. It's an array of strings.
BIG HINT: Even though the ingredient unit is two words, it is seperated by a hyphen.

How do we drill down just that ingredients array? recipe.ingredients

It wants us to use .slice, how do we use this?

We will want to use .forEach({ingred} => {
    let withoutAmount = ingred.slice{ingred.indexOf(' ')};
}

Next we will console.log(withoutAmount)

We will want to use .forEach({ingred} => {
    let withoutAmount = ingred.slice{ingred.indexOf(' ') + 1};
    let withoutAmount = withoutAmount.slice(withoutAmount.indexOf(' ') + 1);
}

console.log(withoutAmount)

We will want to use .forEach({ingred} => {
    let withoutAmount = ingred.slice{ingred.indexOf(' ') + 1};
    let withoutAmount = withoutAmount.slice(withoutAmount.indexOf(' ') + 1);
    result.push(withoutUnit);
}


This could be condensed on one line however
                            Here we pass in the second thing again
let onlyIngred = ingred.slice{(ingredient.indexOf(' '), + 1);
results.push(onlyIngred)
});
return result;





~9:25~ Code Challenge 8 Regex

Regex = Regular Expressions

They are the brunt of all jokes about javascript.

Not very untuitive. Though very powerful.

USAGE: IF I expect a type of data to be in a string. How do I know that this string knows it contains a phone number or an email?

To declare the regex pattern, we create a variable.
let regex = //;    Like this!

let str = '';
let arr = [];

Like these examples, we know that the first one is a string and the second is an array based on their patterns. Regex is exactly the same way.

let regex = /o/
let string = "Fox jumps over the lazy dog";

We want regex to find if this string has the letter "O"

We do this by
let hasPattern = regex.test(str);
console.log(hasPattern);
        YOU DID IT!


        Regex101.com
ECMAScript is the same thing as javaScript

Here we can search for specific letters in the input box.

We can also look for a range of letters.
We do this by: [a-z]

[A-Z]$ looks for the end of the lines for these letters
[A-Za-z]* looks for ??????

If we want to find all of the words that have the letter "O"
\w* o \w*



A REPLIT example:
let reg = /\w*0\w*/gm;

this will returnn an array of all the matches, if there are matches.
Or it will return null if there are none.

let matches = str.match(reg);
console.log(matches);


What if we have code that is explicitly looking for an array?
let matches = str.match(reg) || []
We would give it a value to also have an array to avoid breaking our code.



What about regex numbers?
206-888-8888

^(206)*

This will find specifically 206

Today you will be asked to do Part 1 of Regex
Sheyna will know if you copy and paste it.

Code challenge today uses MATCH and MENTION
For the STRETCH GOAL

    Double check that your .env key is getting pushed up to github because it may get lost.

    Double check locationIQ. HTTP refers should have NETLIFY and LOCALHOST

    <div key=>

    Worked on city-explorer front/backend local code

    HTTP.CAT
    HTTPstatusdogs.com
    These two websites will help you figure out error codes.






~11:14~ Lab 8 Review

We want to give real time weather data rather than hard coded weather data.

Now we get the key.

How do we denote the start of our query string? We use a ?key=

How do we denote a second query? &

Going on TMDB will show us API documentation.
If an API does NOT have a lot of documentation, probably don't use that.

~11:24~ Image tags ???

First part of the assignment, find where the weather data lives.

THEN find information from TMBD for movie data.

API, you CAN use this in your final project but please find something else if you can.

I want to save this. Once We have the key, we must put it in an .env file.

~11:32~ .env
port=3001
UNSPLASH_KEY_API=

Everytime we change an env file, since it is hidden, we must restart the file using nodemon.

~11:34~ This is our URL

If we want to see where we are making our request, we can console.log our URL.

What's the first thing we need to do with localHost3001? We must declare the path.

star route catchall "These are not the droids you're looking for"
~11:38~ 

App.get{(*/photos', {req,res}) = {
    res.send{'photos'};
}};



~11:52~ We will need to enter query

~11:55~ Creating URL

How are we going to make a request, what package do we use? axios

~11:59~ Now we are getting kitten data

We don't want all of this data however, so we will need to create a class. In this case photo class, so that we can drill down for these things.

Make sure to enter a try catch in here.


~12:10~ This is what's happening at each step of this.
res.status
This is sending

We will need to make a movies route similar to the weather route
