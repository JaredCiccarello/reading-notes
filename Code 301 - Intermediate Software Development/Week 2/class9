~9:05~ Code Challenge 8

Question 5

What method would we use? Match

Match returns an array if there are no matches

 Next, when I query your weather route, I can successfully pull data from the movie api?

 It expected an empty array but, received NULL.
This happens when you receive a character ????

If pattern returns NULL it will be seen as falsey.

|| [] This is how we deal with this issue.

~9:20~ 5 is passing




~9:23~ Lab 8 review

When you first get a repo, make sure to npm install

settings.json is where you will make sure to avoid keeping settings being sent to other people.

It will run on 3002. This is because when we first pull a repo it will not have a .env file.
Reminder, once we change an .env file we must always restart the server.

why do we do city.data[0].lat instead of state.data[0].lat
This is because we don't have access to the value in state. It will but, it takes a while. State is slow.


Local HOST issue
If you had a / to localhost3000/ what will happen? This will put in a an extra / because we have already done this when making our URL. Make sure to double check your console when using your front end.


What does AXIOS do? It accesses the API in our server.
Axios goes to make the request for us. 


DEPENDENCY HELL: Someone broke code that we depended on and now our code is breaking.

Request, Response, Next
What does the request and response do?
Request comes from our server
Response is packaged and sent back.
Note: Add in NEXT. Don't worry about what it does.

???????????

~10:20~

Where do find, in our moviesURL, in our backend? app.get '/movies'

What does a ? mean? A query parameter



If a value is undefined, what does that mean we can do on the front end?
Try-Catch OR an If-Else





~10:43~ Code Challenge 9

lets creates an object 
let luck = {
    species: 'dog'
    let: '4'
    color: 'black'
    isHungry: true
}

console.log(lucky.name); for name
console.log(lucky); whole object

ENTRIES
object .entries
        Capitalize the O
let entries = Object.entries(lucky);
This command turns each of our attributes and turns them into an array of arrays from top to bottom.

KEYS
let keys = Object.keys(lucky);
console.log(keys);
This command extract just the keys: Name, Species, Leg, Color. (Not isHungry this is a boolean)
and put them side by side.

VALUES
let values = Object.values(lucky);
console.log(values);
This command extracts just the values: dog, 4, black, true

~11:15~ Get photos




~11:17~ Series of errors and fixes
in backend we use module.exports = getPhotos

We put axios in our new component photo.js in order to 

~11:18?
???????


~11;29~

let params = {
    client_id: process.env.UNSPLASH_API_KEY
}

Tomorrow you will get code that you will need to debug slightly.



CHAINING
let str = 'The force is with you';

let strSplit = str.split(' ');
let strSplice = strSplit.slice(2);
let let strJoin = strSlice.join(' ')



You're probably gonna need to rewatch the video and take notes.
