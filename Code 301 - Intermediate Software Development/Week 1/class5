Warm up Exercise

~9:34~ Code Challenge 4

Question 6

sort does so by default

Look at the sort replit in the class repository, it will help to understand your next steps.


~9:48~ Lab 4 Review

Componentization: Where we can put things

onChange: This refers to an event in our code.

parseInt turns a string into a number

When state is updated render function will re-render the page.

Each individual beast that is iterated over is being asked if it is strictly true or strictly false.

~10:02~
event.target.all

~10:05~ This is what we do if it equals all

What do we need to do to identify all of our beasts in our drop down menu? hornedBeast: data

?????????????

~10:30~ End lab review

~10:32~ Code Challenge 5 REDUCE

Comparing values

Helps by reassigning previous value

Let\'s is our start value

    Rewatch code challenge for better understanding.

How do we refer to an empty array? newSWArr.push()

prev,current
prev is our previous value and current is the next value

console.log(StarWars[7]).episode
console.log(StarWars[7]).['episode']
Does the same thing





~10:53~ Bracket notation

Personal note: Start asking "What are we trying to accomplish? How do we get to that point? What do we need to do? What do we need to know?"

~11:05~ One more tool in your toolbelt


Note: Reduce is a little hard to learn, don't get bummed, just keep going and ask questions.





~11:20~ Lab 5 work with someone else's code

There are no new concepts in this class.

There are two parts:

Part 1: Trello board

Need to make a trello account

Make sure your board is public when creating


We are using CSS3 add this to your resume


~11:01~??????????????

~11:05~
SCSS You can use this to reflect your own.

Prioritize tasks but, don't worry about getting everything done right away.

Be sure to submit all 3 links
Trello
Github
Netlify







~11:54~ Next week preview

~12:01~ THE CLIENT


Server: We will build servers and send requests to it.

Front end: personal computer (Client)
back end: Somebody elses computer (API, Servers)

The way all of these things talk to each other is the web request response cycle.

query: cat photos

Practice targeting specific elements of your data because we will be doing this ALOT.

~12:07~ 
How do I refer to the data array? By calling the filename data.

Find examples on the internet to help you dig down into 

Google: Sample data array then find specific data.

In real world we don't make direct requests to the API. We will for the purpose of this lab.

Go through your hornedbeast code and be sure to add lots of comments.

Follow the logical threads, what is this doing in our code?
