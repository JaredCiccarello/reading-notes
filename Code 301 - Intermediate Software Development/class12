~9:33~ Can of Books Review lab 11

~9:41~ Start of review

Make sure you have your .env pulling your password from mongoDB.

app.get ('/') will give us all the values that we res.send. In our url using only our /.

You must shutdown your server on the backend before you run node seed.js

node seed.js will add our books to our mongo database but, only once and then stops.

CRUD, Mongoose, REST, Axios, Express




~10:34~ Front-End

create a new component cats.js

What do we need? Import, class, and export

When you make a class, what do you need for the class? Render.

import cats into main

~10:45~ Indentation




I want to add cats to database and delete from database
~10:51~

~10:57~??????


~10:58~ Working in back-end

Json data wants quotes.

localhost/cats

This will show up as undefined

We need more middleware like (cors)
We will need app.use(express.json());
^^^^ Must have this in order to get a request from JSON.

Make sure to choose POST inside thunderclient

app.get
app.post
app.delete

app.delete needs an ID sent from the front-end

get the id
localhost:3001/cats/ID-NUMBER-STRING

Next we would need to make another async function
~11:12~

~11:16~ Making fake sage

~11:22~ Added post and delete routes



What is the natural default form of submit? Refresh.
prevent event default. 
We need this to prevent our page from refreshing.

this.state.cats, createdCat.data
Don't forget the .data

When using axios the 3 things that are needed are:
Async
Await
Data

~11:58~ Ending video, rewatch video and take notes.
