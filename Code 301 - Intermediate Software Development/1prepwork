        ## Arrow function Expressions
        This is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression.

       Arrow functions don't have their own bindings to this, arguments, or super, and should not be used as methods. (This, argumentts, super)

       Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors. Calling them with new throws a TypeError. They also don't have access to the new.target keyword.
       
        Arrow functions cannot use yield within their body and cannot be created as generator functions.

Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype.
