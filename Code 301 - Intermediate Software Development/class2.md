Sheyna learned CSS from a book "I could have read that chapter over and over and it would have not made sense. What made sense was moving on to the next chapter."

Allergic to oranges

DO NOT GET HUNG UP ON LEARNING THE STUFF. Get the code working and then spend the time reviewing it.

State and props will make more sense.

Personal note: Take plenty of notes, it may not make sense in the short term but you are planning for the long term. Slow and steady.

~9:10 - ~
    Code Challenge 1

Code 5: Always "return arr;" {Why arr?}

Next arr.push(value)

const addNumbers


Callback: 
Hint: Look at test 5 in the challenge. If I invoke this, then the result will be this.

Using callback to pass into another function.

Copy these examples.
~9:22~ Callback example

Anything that gets passed in here will be the value of "name". We declared that value.

~9:27~ Passing in a second value

Hint: If you're stuck, look at the test code.

~9:39 - 9:48~

foreach, this goes through an inventory that have 'available:true'

availableItems.forEach()


~10:00~ REACT LAB CONTINUED

<> empty will make react happy. Without making an element render on the page.

Main is a component. 

props is an object

~10:21~ Add CSS

CamelCase = Capitalize because HornedBeast is a component.

~10:26~ ???
Class means something different


~10:31~ ARRAY's always return 
CODE CHALLENGE 2

let arr = [1, 2, 3];
let stringArr = ['one', 'two', 'three'];

let newArr = arr.map((num) => {
    return num * 5;
});
console.log (newArr)

let newArr2 = arr.map(num => num * 5);
console.log (newArr2)

let newStrArr = stringArr.map(str => str.toUpperCase());
console.log (newStrArr)



~10:37~ LAB 2 DEPLOYMENT

netlify sign up

You will run into issues if there are errors prior to deployment

command line will show error messages first and then tell you what to do next

~10:44~ Lab Steps explained

~10:47~ app.css

always import and write comments to show what you are doing

~10:49~ Verticle width command allows text to shrink and grow

data.json

~10:53~
import
render function

First thing you do is write a callback function inside of your render function

~10:58~ 
refer to the name of each pep

in this case pep is the entire object of our array.

You can push a react component onto an array

to render the array you just put the array name.

if you get confused on where you are at console.log it!

~11:20~ BOOTSTRAP component

Build a library component 

install bootstrap IN my project

~11:27~Must import bootstrap css for bootstrap styles to apply

~11:30~ Bootstrap library

card images can and WILL be used in your lab today

Real world you will need to time yourself based on how long a project may take

For our lab we want to list how many times an image has LIKES

~11:40~ Creating a CLASS
After creating a class
create constructor
create super
create this.state

greetings should be changed to LIKES in our project

~11:49~ React is written in such a way to allow HTML

this.state.greetings++ Will not work

this.setState({
    greetings: this.state.greetings + 1;
})

~11:56~ event listeners
On react we can put our event listeners inline

~12:00~ How to size down images

width 100%:

~12:02~ Deploy your site!

Check for errors in your console

apply a counter

No longer any errors!


IMPORTANT: on github when you start a pull request it will show your information being pulled from netlify

~12:10~
FINAL NOTE: Put a heart next to each hornedbeast
