Operator ---	Condition	 --- SQL Example
=, !=, < <=, >, >= ---	Standard numerical operators ---	col_name != 4

BETWEEN … AND …	--- Number is within range of two values (inclusive)	--- col_name BETWEEN 1.5 AND 10.5

NOT BETWEEN … AND …	--- Number is not within range of two values 
(inclusive)	--- col_name NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 10

IN (…)	--- Number exists in a list	--- col_name IN (2, 4, 6)

NOT IN (…)	--- Number does not exist in a list	--- col_name NOT IN (1, 3, 5)



Relational Databases and SQL are much more literal when searching for or creating databases.

For example instead of creating `${database}` a template literal to identify specific information. You can specify WHERE BETWEEN AND, these allow for not only easier readability but, ease of use.

Searching something like TITLE is much easier than having to identify specific IDs like in backend databases where the code may be a long string of numbers.


(I tried adding the images here but, for some reason I couldnt get them to render. Forcing me to submit them as images inside of a folder instead of all in one file)
