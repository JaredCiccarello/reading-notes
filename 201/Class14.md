    Psyche safety with Dr. Robin

Worked in non-profit

Making sure that you're watching what you're saying.

Think about what organization will work for you.
Finding what the organization culture is like.

What makes a good organization environment?

What are your expectations? 
    Upward mobility
    Experience gain
    Work Autonomy
    Work-life balance
    Ability to effect change
    Interesting work
    Competetive Salary
    Real job
    job that values my skillzz
    Appreciates differences
    Mentorship (Reach out to power hour individuals and have questions READY, no to I don't know where to start.)
    Safe learning environment
    Merit based professions
    Information sharing
    Collaboration
    Accountability
    Reasonable expectation
    Professionalism
    Clear objectives
    Shared responsibility

Thinking about what you want in an organization is important to avoid being in an environment that doesn't help faciliate these ideas.

You need to make the decision for yourself. Look at the job market and find something that works for you, there is plenty of opportunities.

Value proposition: You are a unique proposition. It's all about how you enter that space. You need to be a professional showing up. I applied because I did my research and I like this company not because I need a job.
