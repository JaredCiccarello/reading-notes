What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?

When choosing a font you'll need to include different styles such as bold and italic. This helps to emphasize content such as keywords, important details or simply wanting to point out specific text to help it stand out. Font size controls how many pixels it will use to make a font taller has on screen. While Font weight controls how thick the font looks on screen. Font style such as with italic, will make your text look canted.
