Manage your time. Make your time with each reading productive, and not a chore. This is not intended to be an exercise in “reading it to memorize it.”
15-30 minutes is adequate time to skim thorough an article; time spent on mastery of specific details from the reading will vary.
Keep in mind that the ability to read and apply documentation is a core skill for developers. There’s always new technologies to learn, and you typically learn them by reading the documentation and then playing around with code samples.

Introductions: Is it feeling hard yet? Don't worry! Keep putting in the time.

Don't worry about comparing, understanding completely, or desparing. It's going to happen but, it is simply part of the process and get the help you need. Take your issues and form them into questions, it'll be fast but, not impossible, you won't need to understand everything 100%.

Everything that's taught to you will be brought to you in pieces. Aim for 80% of understanding what's going on.

    Note the timestamps at the top right of each recording, that will help break up the monotony of the recordings.

You have until Wednesday to get ALL the prepwork done. (Thank God)

Wednesday we move full steam.

Career assignments can be submitted at anytime throughout the course. Reading assignments need to be done the day prior. Labs also cannot be done ahead of schedule.

There is a 101 career assessment that will take time to complete.

Build a network: through meetups lab. 

Ensure you're looking for what jobs are looking for. Even if you are learning python, they may want you to specialize or focus in other languages or technical equipment. Be sure to look out for these when doing some of these assignments.

DO NOT TURN IN ANYTHING LATE. You may submit something and then redo it after the fact.

<DOCTYPE html> When going for job interviews they will ask you how to write lines of code by writing it by hand. Knowing how to do this will also sharpen your understanding.

Inside HTML you simply add a <head> and a <body> tag.

Inside of the <head> use <meta charset="UTF-8"> don't get hung up on this too much

To establish a language use <html lang="en"> for english

Inside the head we need a title as well.

Good idea to leave comment notes for yourself. In order to remind you what you were doing in each line of code.
