# How the web works

Computers connected to the internet - are called clients and servers.

Servers - are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps.

TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet.

DNS: Domain Name System is like an address book for websites. This is like looking up the address of the shop so you can access it.

HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other.

Component files: A website is made up of many different files.

    Code files: Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    Assets: This is a collective name for all the other stuff that makes up a website, such as images, music, video, Word documents, and PDFs.

IP address: are special numbers that look like this: 63.245.215.20

We used the term "packets" to describe the format in which the data is sent from server to client.
