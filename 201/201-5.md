Class 5

Andrew likes witchcraft, smoking joints, and wants to be self employed. Hebrews to Negroes. College is a terrible way to learn.

guess === joints
let guess = prompt('') this datatype is a string
Use parseInt to turn a string back into a number
How do we know the number?

to stop the while loop from continuing indefinitely, use " break; "

You'll need .lowerCase in order to make upper case answers in an array to lowercase. Unless you want to lower case your own answers in the array.

writing !guessCorrect is the same as writing guessCorrect != true

array.length will run each element in the array.

to console.log only one item in the array use, console.log(array[0]) This counts only the first item in the array.

Think of i as an index.

back ticks `` will allow for javascript to read your code. Instead of quotes '' that will require you to add a cacatanation with a + element.

The order matters when assigning variables.

~11:10~
Positioning does not tell where an element needs to be placed.
This is called position:static;
this may not make sense until many months after you are done with the course.

Lab
step 1: Fork partner's repo
step 2: git clone the forked repo
step 3: Partner is going to "navigate" telling me what to write in their code. Take question 1 and invoke it in a function.
step 4: ACP changes for question 1.
step 5: repeat step 3 and 4 for each question.
step 6: Submit a pull request back to partner's repo.
step 7: Check email or github for pull request.
