Questions:
Pycharm license?
Times on top of the screen

In class demo inside class repository

Next week is pair programming
Actually next week after that is also pair programming

Friday's are extremely busy! 9AM career coaching workshop! May take up to over 2 hours!

Monday Juneteenth! Day off!
Fourth of July! Day off!

Code Challenge pair programming

Able to book time with instructor. Or stick around til the end of class.

Whiteboard interview: Ample opportunity to work through.
Couldn't write a for loop, 

Nothing but, you and a whiteboard. There is a ton of practice for this!

-------AWS certifications are extremely beneficial--------



Code Challenge
  Need to have a top level README.md

Python course: LOTS OF AMBIGUITY. They want you to make decisions.

TODAY: is a whiteboard challenge only


Write an array. What could throw you off? No data? One data? An object?

Visualization: A visual breakdown of what's happening.

We want a happy path: A return with no issues.

Algorithm: These are words that explain what you are doing. ONLY WORDS.


TIME AND SPACE 
Time and space complexity: How efficient is your algorithm and code.
Big O
time: o(n)
space: o(1) Not creating new structures

Time complexity: To make it the most efficient as possible.

We look at Big 0 in the worst case scenario. How much time will this take?
o(n) Going all the way to the end
0(1) Gets the 

Space complexity: 
You make a brand new list
Adding one item to the new list
o(1) 

GET RID OF PSEUDO CODE. You will always need to write code.





Example:
Variable max value. 
Is my current index larger than my max value?

Mapping through an array of integers [1, 4, 3, 12, 4]
We want to find the largest integer
If 4 is larger than 1, change it to 4. If 3 is not larger than 4, no change. 12 is larger than 4, change it to 12.


Time and space




GETTING A BOOK OVER 3.6 for python would be most efficient. Anything you're looking at, make sure the version is 3.7 over above.



Pycharm: Better at linting


def get_user_input():
  Curly braces are essentially a thing of the past {}

Python creator wanted Python to be more poetic.

Look at linter errors right away

  # This is in the function 
  If there is nothing inside of here you will get an error

  # This is outside of the function


print ("Please enter your Name")
Using the internal terminal. There COULD be potential errors, be careful this is an EMULATOR. Not a real terminal. Make sure to check your actual terminal.

To enter a command use: python3 main.py


you'll notice you won't get "Please Enter your Name"
you need: get_user_input()
This works similarly to a function. Remmeber when you make a function, you need to call it.

def get_user_input():
using def get_user_input(def=0):
defaults inputs to 0 


print ("Please enter your Name")
input ("> ")
this will add 
Please enter your Name
>


There are three ways to concatonate
~2:47~
f acts similar to a template literal



MAIN GATE
__name__ this means dunder name

if __name__ == "__main__":
This is a dunder main gate

We need a main gate because if we need to import def get_user_input():

We don't want ????? to come with the original function

If we created a main2.py file and then imported def get_user_input():

We will only be able to call the function


However we can call main, which allows us to call all parts of the main.py file

This will help us understand WHEN to use a main gate.


Dunder main is used when you execute a file directly.





GUESSING GAME: I spy

It wants an array of THINGS

def means to define
guess_a_thing(riddle_index)




If you use chatGPT make sure you attribute chatGPT

Find what style you want chatGPT to explain certain code for you. 




LAB 01: Snakes Cafe

You'll be adding your meals to your menu





When setting up your new repo. Your README should have much more detail than usual.

Github ACTIONS ignore this for now




Code challenge
Separate README information

Datastructure and Algorithms README will have links

Cannot use string splicing, reverse method, 


Meeting back at 4 for zoom, 7 my time





















  INTRODUCTION
Kristen Fassler: Campus Director
Pyschology major
TA: Kim Dalas

Plaigarism: Make sure you document your information

Expectations: Instructor approval required, means if you are not a nice person CodeFellows will not back you and will not pass you. Final whiteboard is made to weed people out. BUT Roger, will only fail you on THIS portion based on communication ALONE.

Partner Power hours: Every friday!

Work on your PERSONAL BRANDING!
This is your social media. Don't post things you don't want others to see.

Development of brand: Resume! Pitch! Targeted job search!
Brand brand brand: Mock interviews! Tech interviews! Brand presentation day!


  Career Accelerator Program (CAP) This will be your tool to success

You will be infront of other companies that will help you build that network.


Roger has been at CodeFellows for 5 years. Roger has been through CodeFellows.

Roger worked in IT for 15 years. Two masters degree and two bachelors degrees.
It may take up the halfway point to not FIGHT the system.
15 years in army reserves.
Did a number of years?? in navy.
Huge Star wars nerd.
34 inch monitor.



Got a job at AWS in a month after graduating. This was because of Networking and career events. Met someone at a network event and battabing.

Roger is on
Texas central time


You can have multiple versions of Python on your computer. You could say Python3.7 instead of Python3.11


print('This is your new item' + item)
Strings are SUPER helpful to help provide clarify in your code, as listed above.

Rewatch class videos, won't catch everything the first time.
Watch youtube videos, even if it's old, it will still apply to current python.

SentDex and Corey Schafer are my favorite python youtubers. Whenever you do a youtube search, choose one of their videos. Theyâ€™re usually at the top of the list.
