Questions: How do I manage the world of coding? It looks pretty hopeless for people just starting out. I will be putting in the time but, between coding, networking, creating projects, working on technical interviews it feels like I'll never get to the Roger Huba level.


YOU NEED A MENTOR.
Partner power hour.

Partner schools running the SAME curriculum.

CodeFellows is federally audited.
Meaning, numbers can't be fudged.

Why do people not get it? They think they know better than the system.

Is it a passion? No
Git master job: $200,000 job (5% coding)


PUT IN THE WORK. FOLLOW THE PROCESS.
After you graduate, Roger will give you a pattern to follow.

Mass blast resume.

You will work harder here at CodeFellows than you ever will at the job.

You will be a stronger coder than 99% of college graduates.

DO NOT, just copy code you don't understand








Learn to be autonomous. Don't be afraid to ask questions.
Here is where you make your mistakes.
Going to be moving on when we get the chance. Won't be reviewing for the case of reviewing, be sure to take your time and figure out what you're getting stuck on.
How do you find an answer that you don't know?


Getting started.

Whiteboard: Only going to be written in Python

Testing: What are some possibilities that could break my code?

Remember, the list is looking at the indexes not which is the higher number.
4, 3, 2, 1

What about odd numbers?
1, 2, 3

This would be weird because it's an odd set of numbers.


WHITEBOARD
Focus on the process of whiteboard and be very methodical about your steps.

YOU MUST MEMORIZE THE WHITEBOARD PROCESS. Write it down on a piece of paper. Practice Practice Practice!
Whiteboard should only take 45 minutes in the future.
Focus on the labs, complete it, and THEN come back.

FULL CREDIT FOR YESTERDAYS CODE CHALLENGE

DON'T CODE YET
How do I think? Don't just get to straight to coding. What is the process. It's like jumping into a car, driving around for an hour and then asking where you're going.
Coding WILL come with practice.



orders(item) = 1
This is how PYTHON handles dictionaries

else:
  orders(item) +=1
If there is already one, then add one to this.

(f`** {} **`) f here acts as our template literal.

If you're struggling with DICTIONARIES. Go to w3 schools.





Dunder __name__
if __name__ == "__main__":
This is a dunder main gate

python first.py
  First Module: __main__
ptyhon second.py
  First Module: first

import first, This is not in a function so it will execute first.

File executes top to bottom then runs anything under dunder __main__
Dunder __main__ MUST be at the bottom of your code.

If you execute a file directly, main gate will execute.
If you don't, then it doesn't execute.




.venv
You need to reinstate this environment everytime you run your code
