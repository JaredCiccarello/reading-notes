"The Ethical Dilemmas of Self-Driving Cars" explores the ethical challenges posed by the emergence of autonomous vehicles. It discusses the complex decisions self-driving cars might have to make in situations where human lives are at stake. The article delves into the infamous "trolley problem," a thought experiment that raises questions about how self-driving cars should prioritize different lives in potentially fatal situations. It highlights debates among experts about whether such moral choices should be pre-programmed or left up to the car's AI system to decide in real-time. The article also emphasizes the need for industry collaboration, regulatory frameworks, and public discourse to establish ethical guidelines that align with societal values as self-driving technology continues to advance.

I don't agree that cars should be automated but, I do like the idea that we are getting to an age where automation is the wave of the future.
