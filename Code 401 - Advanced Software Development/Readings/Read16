What are the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?
  Key characteristics are:
  No server
  Event driven
  Pay-per-use
  Automatic Scaling
  Stateless Execution
  Microservices

  This differs from traditional server based architectures by scalibility, code modeling, resource allocation and infrasctructure management.

How can one get started with Vercel, and what are the main steps involved in deploying a serverless function using Vercel?
  1. Install Vercel from vercel.com
  2. Create project
  3. Create Serverless function:
    module.export = (req, res) => {
      res.status(200).send('');
    }
  4. Test the function
  5. Deploy Vercel
  6. Go to deployed function
  7. Manage deployments.

What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?
  API is short for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that communicate with software applications to allow them to interact with one another. 
  In Python you can access and manipulate data from external sources you do this by selecting an API, installing the necessary library, acquiring an access key, make a request, handle the response, manipulate the data, and handle any errors.

What is the Requests library in Python, and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?
   Requests library in Python is an HTTP library that simplifies making HTTP requests, including interacting with APIs.
   To use this to interact with API's you:
   1. Import Requests
   2. Send get request:
    response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
   3. Check the status code looking for status code 200
   4. Use Json method to parse data.
Now you have your request!
