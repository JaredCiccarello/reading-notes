What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?
  The key difference between class and objects is:
  Class, acts as a user defined data type. 
  Object, is an instance of a class. 

  Classes are used to create objects which in turn creates instances. 

Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?
  Recursion is a program function that calls itself. This helps by breaking them down into smaller problems.
  It can be used to solve a problem in python by, using a number of different methods. 
  A couple of these we have already used, like the Fibonacci sequence. This sequence calls the previous two numbers and adds the result.
  Lucas sequence also adds the first two numbers but, in the fibonacci the first two numbers are 0 and 1. In the lucas they are 2 and 1. 

  The best practice when using a recursive function are to define a base case. The base case determines where a recursion should stop.
  Memory usage is also very important as recursion can consume a significant amount of memory.
  Make sure to test and debug carefully in order to prevent any hiccups in your code.


What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.
  Pytest is used to manage apps states and dependencies. More importantly they can provide data for testing. Some of the different types are integers, strings, lists, dictionaries, and booleans.
  
  They can help with the maintainability of a project by setting up test data and ensuring tests are executed in a controlled and predictable environment. This also helps because you can define a fixture once and resuse it multiple times.
