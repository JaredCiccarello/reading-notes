1. How can the random module be utilized in Python to generate random numbers or make selections from a list, and what are some common functions available within the module?
  random(): This function returns a random float number between 0 and 1 (inclusive of 0, exclusive of 1).
  randrange(start, stop, step): This function returns a randomly selected element from the specified range.
  randint(a, b): This function returns a randomly selected integer from the specified range, including both endpoints.
  choice(sequence): This function returns a random element from a non-empty sequence such as a list or a tuple.
  shuffle(sequence): This function shuffles the elements of a sequence randomly in place.

2. In the context of software development, what is risk analysis, and what are the key steps involved in conducting a risk analysis for a software project?
  Risk identification, assessment, prioritization, mitigation, monitoring, and documentation.


3. What is test coverage and why is it an important (or potentially misleading) metric in software testing?
  This is useful for identifying untested code, testing for quality, mitigating risks, refactoring. This can be misleading because it leads to a false sense of security. This is also misleading because testing shows the level of quantity but, not test for the level of quality.

4. What is Big O notation, and how is it used to describe the performance of an algorithm? Give an example of an everyday task (not software related) that demonstrates O(n) time complexity.
   Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the performance or time complexity of an algorithm.
   Searching for a specific item in an unsorted list, would be an example of time complexity.
