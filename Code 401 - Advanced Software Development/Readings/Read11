1. What are the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how does it differ from Jupyter Notebook?
  A few key features are:
  1. Multi language support
  2. Flexible Interface
  3. Rich text editor

  Jupyter lab differs from Jupyter Notebook because Jupyter Lab extends the capabilities of Jupyter Notebook. 

2. What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?
  The main functionalities are: multi-dimensional array support, mathematical operations, broadcasting, indexing and slicing, array manipulation, and efficient computation, make it an essential tool for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks in Python.

3. Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.
  The basic structure and properties of NumPy include: Array indexing, Properties, creation, manipulation, and operations. 

  Examples of these look like:

    Array Indexing: 
    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    arr = np.array(my_list)

    Array Properties:
    arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    print(arr.shape)  # Output: (2, 3)

    Array Indexing and Slicing:
    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    print(arr[2])  # Output: 3

    Array Manipulation:
    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    reshaped_arr = arr.reshape((2, 3))  # Reshape to a 2x3 array
    print(reshaped_arr)

     Array Operations:
     arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
     arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
     sum_arr = arr1 + arr2
     print(sum_arr)  # Output: [5 7 9]
