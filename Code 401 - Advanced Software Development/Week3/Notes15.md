90% of employers have never retracted an offer just because someone negotiated.

Ask about review cycles








  TREEs reading: Plan to read this a few times
Datastructures and algorithms
  Binary trees have multiple ways of traversing. This is not similiar to stacks and queues. This is recrusion.

Node class is going to a value but, now it has a left and right child.

What does a binary tree know? Root
Stack starts at top: Top
Queue: Front
LinkedList: Head

K-ary trees: Have 3 children!
Edge: Link between two nodes. The connection string. 
Leaf: Has no children

    Pre-order: Root, left, right
    In-order: Left, root, right
    Post-order: left, right, root

Parent is also a root.

    A
  B     C
D  E   F

Pre-order: A, B, D, E, C, F
In-order: D, B, E, A, F, C
Post-Order: D, E, B, F, C, A

BINARY SEARCH TREE
Binary-Search tree: Traditionally be some kind of number
Every node to the left will be less than the root. 
If the root is 100, then everything will have be >100
Every node to the right will be more than the root.
If the root is 100, then everything will have be <100
  O of log n 
  this means every you can cut out half of the tree at every traversal
No duplicates



BINARY TREE
Does not follow the search trees logic.
Binary Tree knows where it starts AND what it's root is.
Binary Tree can be ANYTHING, letters, nodes, numbers etc.
