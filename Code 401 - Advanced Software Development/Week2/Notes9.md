60 second pitch

Jared Ciccarello I'm a software developer

Growing up I always wanted to help people, to serve in a capacity that allowed me to refine myself. This was never more true than when I went into the military. I believe in being able to help people, to work side by side with others in a way that helps us all move forward.

During my time in the marines I learned about perseverance, self discipline, and teamwork. When I left the military I ased myself where I'd like to take these skills but, I never gave education much thought. However I like a challenge, so when I heard of coding I couldn't wait to get started. Similar to my experience when joining the marines, I thought that coding was something that would be beyond me. I realized that the only thing that stopped me was my own concerns about what problems I might run into, that's when I realized that coding is just another problem to solve.

I chose this specific skill because I see myself as a problem solver, as someone who truly wants to make a change for myself and my family. I saw an opportunity to learn a powerful language in coding like Python and I went after it. I interviewed with several bootcamps, 6 to be exact and found CodeFellows to be the perfect fit.

My strengths lie in my ability to work with nearly any group and stick with something even when things get hard. I'm a natural communicator, a peoples person, and I'm adaptable. 

I plan to use this skill to develop new technology for people. Things like working in back-end in order to give people a more interactive experience.









QUEUES
Knows its front and it's rear.

Queue
Front = Node 1
Rear = Node

Node 1 = Value 1 Next None
Node 2 = Value 2 Next None
Node 3 = Value 3 Next None
Node 4 = Value 4 Next None

How did we get access to make these next?

Person 1 is in the front
person 2 will come up and get handed "rear" from person 1
person 3 will come up and get handed "rear" from person 2



NO WHITEBOARDS
Implementations will not have a whiteboard. This is just coding.


Where do we start?
