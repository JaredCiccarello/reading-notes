Exercise
    Return same order in the linked list that is a string

    One node in the linked list
    Only have one character that is a lower case character a-z

    - Write a function that takes a linked_list with single letters as values, and returns all the letters in a single string.
    `[p] -> [y] -> [t] -> [h] -> [o] -> [n] -> None`
    - returns 'python'

    Do everything on the whiteboard. Don't look anything up.

Problem domain
Input/put (Test cases)
Visualization

Make sure you are thinking about other possibilities. Write tests are numbers, tests for capitals.

PRINT OUT EXAMPLE AND GO THROUGH EACH STEPS!

ALMOST always when working with linked list you will be doing some kind of traversal.

NODE is just an object in memory.




NOTE: This runs under your tests file
to get around TargetError:
use
class TargetError(Exception)
  pass

try: 
  ll.insert.after(5, 3)
except Target(error)



BUILTINS
import builtins

_print = builtins.print
_input = builtins.input

def alter()
    builtins.print = _input
    builtins.input = _print

alter()

print('What is your name?')

Pi test coverage is often employed in combination with other coverage metrics, such as statement coverage, branch coverage, and condition coverage, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the testing process. While traditional coverage metrics focus on achieving a certain percentage of coverage (e.g., 80% statement coverage), pi test coverage emphasizes the diversity and variety of test scenarios exercised.

This will show a percentage. If you're only covering 20%, you'll need to write more code.

Find ways to bypass flow?

flow.py is a great thing to get setup.

The automated tests, you do not have to pass those tests.

Need to have messages that tell the user:
What round
How many dice
how to quit

Once dice are rolled:
What was the result?
Roll again? Press r
Bank your points? press b
How many points were banked?
What's your overall score?
What round are we in?

MIDTERM project
You will build a command line application.
You may need to build flow.py
Make sure to have test coverage

Start thinking of what you want to program.
