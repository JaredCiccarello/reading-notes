What are the key principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python, and how do they contribute to the overall quality of code?

  The 5 basic principles of TDD are:
    Add a test.
    Run all tests and see if any new test fails.
    Write some code.
    Run tests and Refactor code.
    Repeat.

  These steps help better design. These steps help to catch bugs and improve maintainability.

Explain the purpose of the if __name__ == '__main__': statement in Python scripts. What are some use cases for including this conditional in your code?
  By using the if __name__ == '__main__': statement, you can include a block of code that will only run when the script is executed as the main program.

  Some cases for this are testability and organizing code.


Describe the concept of recursion in Python.
  This is a defined function that can call itself.

What is the difference between Python modules and packages? Explain how to create, import, and use them in your Python programs.
  A python module is a single file that contains defintions and statements. While a package is a way of organizing those modules.

  In Python script, use .py extension in order to create new python file.
  
  In Python script, use the import statement to import the module.

  In order to use, import statement to import modules from the package.
