In the context of the reading “Pain and Suffering,” describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and suggest at least two strategies for overcoming these obstacles.
Knowledge is PAIN and suffering is pain without ambition. Beginners of Python do not know this. Experts in Python have come to accept this.
  1. Remembering why you chose this for yourself and to keep going.
  2. Ensuring you don't give up even though it's difficult. You will for-go sleep, exercise, and personal time to excel in python, stay focused.

After reading “Beginners Guide to Big O,” explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity.
   O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

Based on the “Names and Values in Python” reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.
  Immutable data is data that cannot be modified. In order to change these values you will need to create new objects. 
  x=5 changed to x = x + 1 making new x = 6

  Mutable data allows modifications. This allows you to modify data without new objects.
  A list of my_list=1,2,3,4 can have 5 added to the end of this list without adding a new object of my_list
