Technical Interview questions.

These will be asked in rapid fire succession.

What is a wrapper function?
What is slicing in python?
What is the difference between an array and a list?


Did these questions throw you off guard? Good! This is the way that it will be in a real interview.

Here is a list of top 100+ python interview questions. Look over different articles and questions to see what kind of questions you'll be asked.



Github
Don't delete your repos.
Don't forget your green squares!


Private contributions: TURN THIS ON!

Jobs are looking at your commit messages.
Keep things professional, no "This shit sucks"
README's are HUGE.

Making sure you have a good README is crucial to your projects success. You add in navbars, or photos.



replit.com
Taking the code from replit and putting this into a word doc.

Some companies may make you code inside of a word doc.



HackerRank 
Codeshare.io
coderpad.io/sandbox
many more...

HackerRank is a HUGE platform that many companies use. They use this because this is a shared environment.


Practice with an online editor.



Getting practice with whiteboard:




HOW TO CONTINUE TO PRACTICE
- Know ahead of time what tools you will use in an interview
- Online IDE's that verify your solutions with tests: LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeWars, open.kattis.com

Roger will not be here Wed.
Roger is traveling to seattle on Thur.

Computer science graph is called a vertices.
Vertix AKA node. Can have zero or more adjacent vertixes.

This means it can have mutliple neighbors, up to 100 or more.
A C B
D E F

How do we get to F from A using 4 points?

D E C B F

What are some real world examples of a directed graph or bidirected graph?
Sprinkler system
Airlines
Social media



Disconnected graph may not have edge (connections) this is a real possibility.

There are two ways that we represent graphs:
Adjacency matrix
Adjacency list

We won't be using the A matrix.

Graph implementation

 A node or a vertix is an object. This object will have something in it.

Vertix knows where it can get to.


A good example of how to get methods started.

Create the function that you will need.

def add_vertext(self):
def add_edge(self):

Then add doc strings from the featured tasks.


new_vertex = Vertex(value)
self.adjacency_list[new_vertex] = []
return new_vertex
