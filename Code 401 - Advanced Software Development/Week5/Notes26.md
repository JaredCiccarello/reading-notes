Lacking motivation?
  CAREER: Look over this video again
Career advice! Keep doing the things they are talking about!
Last class was 9 people. 40% of them are in the industry.

If you delay career assignments to the end, you may end up with an extra 2-4 months of job search.

      Don't get in your own way. Keep reaching out! Talk to people that are speakers and not just people looking for a job. Once you have some time off, you'll have more time to work on these issues.

Job search is down 50%, true however you can continue looking.

AWS and google is working their dev's overtime. Dev's usually leave within their first year.

Chance favors the prepared mind. Did I get lucky? Yes! But! I did everything I was supposed to do.

Enthusiastic about the job field. If you don't like writing code, you'll get burnt out fast.

If you are not excited about code, then you'll hate going to your job. However, people will typically only be coding 20 hours a week and not your whole day.

Some people love sales.

Summary: Is there a downcurve of software devs? Yes! Will that always be the case? No!
Keep going! It may take you 6 months but, don't stop!
