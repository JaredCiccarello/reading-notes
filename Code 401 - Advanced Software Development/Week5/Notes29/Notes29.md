Brush up on LinkedList, Nodes, and data structures.

Binary search
Stack
queue
list
matrix (List of lists)
etc

All the data structures.

Do your personal pitch. Make sure you talk through each steps. If you talk through your problems you will more likely get help.

Provide additional examples.

Check the grading rubric, it's the exact way that you will be tested. EXACT.

Spend at least 30 min a day testing your whiteboard skills.

YOU DO NOT HAVE TO 100% SOLVE THE PROBLEM TO PASS.

End of week 8 there will be whiteboard challenges. You will go through as many rounds as necessary, as long as you are getting better.

36/45

5 point just for a good pitch.
-Relative background
-Previous experience

2 points for Meaningful and clarifying questions. 

You can game this out for yourself.

Lab 29 overview

You'll have two choices.
1. Use your own template
2. Use DjangoX as a template.

HIGHLY recommend using your own.

Getting started:
You can take the code you need as your very own project and not a clone.
Why?

Cloning this you'll see that many of the features are similar to how we've made our websites with Django over the last few days.

Having two homepage views, in two seperate app projects, will NOT conflict.

When making a larger project, break it down into multiple apps.

Instead of vanilla css
try to use tailwinds and flowbyte

MUST add .gitignore

two pages
full crud

Why would I want to delte .git to detach from my respository?
