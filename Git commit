^ : Caret operator
This moves upwards one commit at a time

~<num> : This allows you to move upwards a number of times
git checkout HEAD~4

This allows you to look up the parent of using main^

main^^ Lets you look up the grandparent of main

This makes it easier than typing the commit hash

git checkout c3, git checkout HEAD^



-f : Reassigns branch to a commit
git branch -f main HEAD~3
This moves (by force) the main branch to three parents behind HEAD

git branch -f main C6



Git Reset
 reverses changes by moving a branch reference backwards in time to an older commit.
Git reset HEAD~1
  This method doesn't work for remote branches that others are using.
In order to reverse changes and share those reversed changes with others, we need to use git revert.
