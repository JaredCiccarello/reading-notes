What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
  One thing I bring to the career, that no one else brings is my unique blend of leadership, attitude, and love of all things gaming. I believe my combination of attributes make me more comfortable to work with, instead of someone who may be awkward or robotic. 

What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
  Referring to my notes really helps me to stay on top of my notes in the first place. I get flustered at the first sign of trouble and then will refer to my notes from class and find something in the lecture that gave me more insight on the second and third look over.
  ScreenShotting important details are also super important and help me to want to create a neat file structure for future refreshers.
